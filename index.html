<h2 class="slideButton">About us</h2>
<p>The Poopsie People is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIHxYsy-F7yEqam-0kHgt-A" target="_blank">youtube channel</a> that makes comedy sketches. The most well-know being the one that the channels name is derived from, Oopsie Poopsie. We don't always make Oopsie Poopsie, but each new chapter requires more work than the last, robbing us of time to work on other videos, so please be patient with us. We ensure quality content!</p>
